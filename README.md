## About

ReadMe is an android app (at the moment) that takes advantage of Google's Firebase text recognition
 API in order to do real-time text translation to dyslexic friendly typeface using the phone camera.
 In addition, ReadMe is able to read gallery images, relaying them to the user by text-to-speech and
 dyslexic friendly typeface. The design of the application is  focused around a color-blind palette
 and large, hard to miss buttons to get users straight to the purpose of the app: to help.

 ReadMe currently supports some Latin-based languages, including English, French, and Spanish, in both OCR and text-to-speech.



As of right now, ReadMe is compatible with Android 10, Android Pie, and some past versions as well.



## Origins of Project

ReadMe was created initially at Hack @ Brown 2020 by Joe Han, Jeremy Chen, Jason Ho, and Steven Cheung.

## Usage

This app is currently not live on the Play Store. Feel free to download the app files, but please note that you will need your own google-services.json for the API to function correctly. 

## Future Implementations

- Planning on adding more language support as dyslexic font is created, especially for East Asian languages
- Feature to freeze live camera feed so the OCR is more readable
- Make black text boxes larger, change size of text to be dynamic
- Update camera feed less often so the live camera OCR is more readable
