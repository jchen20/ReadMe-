## About 

ReadMe is an android app (at the moment) that takes advantage of Google's Firebase text recognition
 API in order to do real-time text translation to dyslexic friendly typeface using the phone camera.
 In addition, ReadMe is able to read gallery images, relaying them to the user by text-to-speech and
 dyslexic friendly typeface. The design of the application is  focused around a color-blind palette
 and large, hard to miss buttons to get users straight to the purpose of the app: to help.
 
 ReadMe currently supports Latin-based languages, including English, French, and Spanish, in both OCR and text-to-speech.



As of right now, ReadMe is compatible with Android 10, Android Pie, and past versions as well.



## Origins of Project

ReadMe was created initially at Hack @ Brown 2020 by Joe Han, Jeremy Chen, Jason Ho, and Steven Cheung. 



## Future Implementations

- Planning on adding more language support as dyslexic font is created, especially for East Asian languages
